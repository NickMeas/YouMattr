# YouMattr
 
YouMattr, a word play that makes it sound like "You Matter", is a chatbot project that I started for people with severe social anxiety and those who are introverts such as myself.
The bot's name is W.A.L.L.Y. which is an acronym for Warmth And Laughter Light Your days. The bot is deployed on Telegram, a free and accessible messaging platform.

W.A.L.L.Y. is a retrieval based bot that analyses the text that users sent to it and it will reply with a large set of pre-written responses that was scraped from real online forums of people and therapist answers.
